# Responsive Webpage-Intership

This webpage was developed as part of the ALX-Gig-At-Startup program, a 36-hour internship
that challenged me to apply my skills to real-world projects. The project was also integral
 to my skill development program. I was assigned to design and build a website for SafeSmart
  Company, and this webpage showcases my efforts.
